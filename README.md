# docker-gmvault

Docker image for `gmvault` working from a directory of config and data.

Expects a volume to be mounted:-

* `/data` - A directory which has one subdirectory per backup

In each subdirectory is:-

* `email_address` - a file containing the gmail address being backed up
* `gmvault_defaults.conf` - config file (generated by gmvault)
* *email\_address*`.oauth2` - the oath2 tokens
* `db` - gmvaults db - leave well alone

Runs once and stops.  Auth needs to be sorted out outside.
